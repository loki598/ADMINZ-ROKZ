# LBSA - Linux Basic Security Audit script
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (c) Neale Rudd, 2008-2014, All rights reserved
# Download latest version from http://wiki.metawerx.net/wiki/LBSA
# Version 1.0.49
# Last updated 31/03/2014 5:25AM
#
# License: GPL v3
# Language: Shell script (bash)
# Required permissions: root or equivalent
# Script type: Check and report (no modifications are made to your system)
# Expected output: System Checks Completed
#
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GUIDE
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script runs a series of basic linux security checks for Continuous
# Policy Enforcement (CPE).  It is, and will always be, a work in progress.
# The script was originally designed for use on Ubuntu, but will most likely
# work with other distros.
#
# The checks are far from exhaustive, but can highlight some basic setup
# issues from default linux installs and continuously enforce policies that
# you require in your specific environment.
#
# These checks include a subset of setup policies which I use for hardening
# server configurations.  As such, not all checks may be suitable for your
# environment.  For example, I don't allow root to login over SSH.  This may
# cause issues in your environment, or may be too restrictive for home use in
# some cases.
#
# If your own settings are more restrictive than these, or you have your own
# opinions on the settings, then modify this script to suit your own purposes.
# The main idea is to have a script that can enforce your own policies, and to
# run it regularly.  It is not necessary to follow my policies line-by-line.
#
# That said, this script should be suitable for most servers and home users
# "as-is", and for other admins it should give you some ideas for your own
# script, or at very least should make for a good read :-)
#
# Usage notes
# Ideally, this script would be called by a wrapper script of your own, which
# implements other checks more specific to your environment.  For example,
# if you run Apache, you may want to also check various folder permissions
# for Apache, then call this script as the final step of your own script.
# The script should be called regularly by cron or another scheduler and mail
# results to the administrator for review if the output changes.
#
# Criticisms and Counter Arguments (Feb 2013)
# In a comment on reddit, someones mentioned I ought to be dunked in honey
# and given to a colony of ants for writing lines that are longer than 80
# characters.  I agree and I now have a new fear on ants, thank you.
# Many lines are still longer than 80 characters.  Sorry, they just are.
# They also commented that passwd -l root will lock the root account from
# accessing the console.  This may be correct but I still recommend it.
# They also commented that if there is proper configuration management, then
# checking folder and file permissions is unnecessary.  I respectully disagree.
# If a system is breached, folder and file permissions may be changed and
# continuous policy checking is one way to be alerted to such a change quickly.
# Finally, they commented that "moving the SSH port from 22, which is asinine
# and provides no actual protection, simply makes it more difficult for people
# to manage those systems."  I also respectfully disagree with that - Port
# scanning bots hit port 22 and changing the default port helps to reduce
# automated threats.  Using a different port than 22 does not make it more
# difficult to manage systems if you are using a configuration management
# system or only have a single server to worry about.

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO USE
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# First, change parameters in the SETTINGS section to suit your environment,
# or call this script from a wrapper script that sets these variables.
#
# The script should be executed as root with bash.
# eg:
#   export LBSA_PERMITTED_LOGIN_ACCOUNTS="nrudd|sjackson"
#   bash sec_lbsa.sh
#
# A series of checks are executed
# No modifications are performed
#
# Running this script should produce no result except the phrase
# "System Checks Completed", at position 0 of the output.
# If there is any other output, then one or more warnings have been issued
#
# This can be used in cron or another scheduler to send a mail using a command
# like the following:
#   export LBSA_PERMITTED_LOGIN_ACCOUNTS="nrudd|sjackson";
#   LBSA_RESULTS=`bash sec_lbsa.sh`;
#   if [ "$LBSA_RESULTS" != "System Checks Completed" ]; then {your sendmail command here}; fi
#
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SETTINGS
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Settings are in if-blocks in case you want to call this script from a
# wrapper-script to avoid modifying it.  This allows for easier upgrades.

# Permitted Login Accounts
#    Specify the list of permitted logins in quotes, separated by |
#    If there are none, just leave it blank.  root should not be listed here, as we don't want root logging in via SSH either.
#    Valid examples:
#    LBSA_PERMITTED_LOGIN_ACCOUNTS=""
#    LBSA_PERMITTED_LOGIN_ACCOUNTS="user1"
#    LBSA_PERMITTED_LOGIN_ACCOUNTS="user1|user2|user3"
